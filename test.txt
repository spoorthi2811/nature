nature is what we see and feel around us
nature is like our mother who never scolds us unless we do anything wrong
i am happy to interact with nature and also be happy to be a part of this earth.
the nature is very attarctive and full of my favorite green colour.
it provides us air to breath the water to drink the soil to make a home and the land to stay.
